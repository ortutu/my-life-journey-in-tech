 my name is confidence, and i want to talk about my life journey on tech.
when i was little i planned on becoming a doctor but as i grew i started
to gain an interest in tech.i wanted to know how to create gadgets,websites,
apps and so on. so when i was done with school i started to practice by my
self 
. then i became good and efficient in the tech perspective. thats was how 
i became a tech genius
